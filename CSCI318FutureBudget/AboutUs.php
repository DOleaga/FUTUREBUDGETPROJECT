    <h1> About Us </h1>

    <h2>
        The Future Budget Team was founded in 2022 as our team wanted to address budgeting issues within our company.
        As discussions sparked, we had came to the realization that the company's spending habits are influenced greatly
        by the individuals that make it up. To confront this issue, we decided to create a financial management tracker 
        for our company as well as for everyday use.

    <h2>
        Future Budget is dedicated to helping users save as much as possible for that rainy day.
        As nice as it is to be subscribed to every streaming platform out there for exclusives, those bills can pile up.
        Along with these are essential bills that eat away at your paycheck in no time.
        In order to keep track of everything in one place, we provide an interactive environment for users
        to modify their transactional views as they please.
